News since version 2:

  - A metadata browser has been added in emms-browser.el.
  - Recording of the time a track was last played is now supported.
  - emms-play-* and emms-add-* functions now toggle their play/add
    behavior when a prefix argument is supplied.
  - EMMS now caches tracks, which speeds up loading of large
    collections with info tags considerably.
  - EMMS now knows how to change the volume (emms-volume.el).
  - When playing a playlist from emms-playlist-mode, EMMS now
    optionally opens a new buffer for this playlist.

  User-visible bug fixes:
  - The emms-playlist-mode is now much faster
